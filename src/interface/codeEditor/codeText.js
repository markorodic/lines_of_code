** Gesture code editing challenge **
 
------------------------------------
 
Hello 👋, this is a short coding challenge similar to vim golf - but using a gestural interface. This editor is intended for mobile use.
 
The editor is comprised of a code view and a gesture pad. Begin by scrolling down 👇 using the gesture pad.
 
------------------------------------
 
# INSTRUCTIONS 📝
 
There are two types of gestures: motions and operations.
  
## Motions
 
Move up a line:
    - swipe up or left
 
Move down a line:
    - swipe down or right
 
## Operations
 
Operations are performed on entire lines and will only be executed when you release your finger on mobile and click on desktop.
 
Valid gestures are displayed in the header when you begin moving. They are:
- delete
- copy
- paste
- cut
 
Try moving around the gesture pad to get a feel for how the cursor moves.

Once you've got that, create an operation gesture but don't let go. When an operation gesture is matched, the line will be highlighted in the code and drawn in the gesture pad. Now let go and the operation will be executed.

# Challenge 🎯
 
You will need to edit the text labeled START to match the END text. This is a timed challenge ⏳, so try and complete it as quickly as you can.
 
Restart the challenge by pressing: 🔄
And once your code is correct press: ✔️
Great! Press the ▶️ button in the header to get started.
